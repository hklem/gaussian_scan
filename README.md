# Gaussian Scan

Gaussian Scan is a Python program that will generate Guassian input files (.com) that translate an atom or group of atoms along a defined nuclear collective variable. 

As of current, the collective variable can only be defined as the distance between two atoms. Thus, the script will generate .com files that increment the user-defined atom groups along this collective variable distance vector. 

Future plans for this code include implementing molecular center-of-mass to define the collective variable distance vector.
